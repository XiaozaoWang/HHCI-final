      Abstract
    </h2>

    <p>
      The development and diffusion of the WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer) interface was made possible by the
      contributions of individual and organizational pioneers, whose efforts transformed the way people interact with
      computers. From the early envisions of graphic user interfaces by Ivan Sutherland and Douglas Engelbart in the
      1960s and 1970s, to the intensive research in Xerox PARC which gave birth to the earliest personal computers using
      the desktop metaphor, to the remarkable story of Apple turning it into a true commercial product, countless
      researchers worked together to bring revolutionary changes to human-computer interaction. Today, we still live in
      Xerox ALTO's world, as the WIMP interface remains central to our daily computing experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      By tracing the history of the WIMP interface, I want to reflect on how our daily interaction with computers was
      broken down, conceptualized and invented, as well as identify the crucial individuals and organizations that
      contribute to those inventions. A critical analysis of the technological, social, and human factors that shaped
      the WIMP interface will be conducted, with a view to envisioning its future potential.
